#ml - Machine learning algorithms (Python, R, Java, Octave)
##The materials will be constantly supplemented/developed

This repository contains:
- machine learning algorithms based on coursers Machine Learning course provided by Prof. Andrew Ng 
- machine learning algorithms that are not described in the above (in the future all will be pointed out here) 
- most of the described algorithms are implemented in Python, R, Java (in the future also Octave but at this moment because of the coursera honor code it wouldn't be appropriate)
- quick review of 
    +   Python  
    +    R 
    +    Java 
    +    Octave 
    +    Linear Algebra <br>

All above are provided with exercises <br>
